# Building for Supported Renesas Boards

AGL supports building for several automotive
[Renesas](https://www.renesas.com/us/en/solutions/automotive.html) board kits.
Renesas is the number one supplier of vehicle control microcontrollers and
System on a Chip (SoC) products for the automotive industry.

This section provides the build and deploy steps you need to create an
image for the following Renesas platforms:

* [Renesas R-Car Starter Kit Pro Board](https://www.elinux.org/R-Car/Boards/M3SK)
* [Renesas R-Car Starter Kit Premier Board](https://www.elinux.org/R-Car/Boards/H3SK)
* [Renesas Salvator-X Board](https://www.elinux.org/R-Car/Boards/Salvator-X)
* [Renesas Kingfisher Infotainment Board](https://elinux.org/R-Car/Boards/Kingfisher)

**NOTE:** You can find similar information for the Pro and Premier board kits on the
[R-Car/Boards/Yocto-Gen3](https://elinux.org/R-Car/Boards/Yocto-Gen3) page.
The information on this page describes setup and build procedures for both these
Renesas development kits.

You can find more information on building images from these resources:

* [AGL-Devkit-Build-your-1st-AGL-Application.pdf](https://iot.bzh/download/public/2016/sdk/AGL-Devkit-Build-your-1st-AGL-Application.pdf)
 Generic guide on how to build various application types (HTML5, native, Qt, QML, â€¦) for AGL.
 This is really about building an application and not the AGL image.
* [AGL-Devkit-HowTo_bake_a_service.pdf](https://iot.bzh/download/public/2016/bsp/AGL_Phase2-Devkit-HowTo_bake_a_service.pdf)
 Generic guide on how to add a new service in the BSP.
 Goes back to 2015 and uses Yocto 2.x.
 Includes stuff on building an image but looks like the focus is really the service.

## 1. Downloading Proprietary Drivers

Before setting up the build environment, you need to download proprietary drivers from the
[R-Car H3/M3 Software library and Technical document](https://www.renesas.com/us/en/solutions/automotive/rcar-download/rcar-demoboard-2.html)
site.
This download site supports the Pro and Premier board starter kits.

**NOTE:** Not sure what you do if you are using the Salvator-X or Kingfisher Infotainment boards.

Follow these steps to download the drivers you need:

1. **Determine the Files You Need:**

     Run the ``setup_mm_packages.sh`` script as follows to
     display the list of ZIP files containing the drivers you need.
     Following is an example:

     ```bash
     grep -rn ZIP_.= $AGL_TOP/meta-agl/meta-agl-bsp/meta-rcar-gen3/scripts/setup_mm_packages.sh
     ```

     The script's output identifies the files you need to download from the page.

2. **Get Your Board Support Package (BSP) Version:**

   Be sure to have the correct BSP version of the R-Car Starter Kit
   based on the version of the AGL software you are using.
   Use the following table to map the Renesas version to your AGL software:

     | AGL Version| Renesas version |
     |:-:|:-:|
     | AGL master | 4.1.0 |
     | AGL jellyfish 10.0.0 | 3.21.0 |
     | AGL icefish 9.0.0 9.0.1 9.0.2 9.0.3| 3.21.0 |
     | AGL halibut 8.0.2 8.0.3 8.0.4 8.0.5 8.0.6| 3.21.0 |
     | AGL halibut 8.0.1 | 3.19.0 |
     | AGL halibut 8.0.0 | 3.15.0 |
     | AGL guppy 7.0.4 | 3.21.0 |
     | AGL guppy 7.0.3 | 3.19.0 |
     | AGL guppy 7.0.0 7.0.1 7.0.2 | 3.9.0 |
     | AGL flounder 6.0.3, 6.0.4 6.0.5 | 3.9.0 |
     | AGL flounder 6.0.0, 6.0.1, 6.0.2 | 3.7.0 |
     | AGL eel 5.0.x, 5.1.0| 2.23.1 |
     | AGL dab 4.0.x |2.19.0 |

   **NOTE:**
   Find the appropriate download links on the
   [R-Car H3/M3 Software library and Technical document](https://www.renesas.com/us/en/solutions/automotive/rcar-download/rcar-demoboard-2.html)
   site.
   The file pairs are grouped according to the Yocto Project version you are
   using with the AGL software.

3. **Download the Files:**

   Start the download process by clicking the download link.
   If you do not have an account with Renesas, you will be asked to register a free account.
   You must register and follow the "Click Through" licensing process
   in order to download these proprietary files.

   If needed, follow the instructions to create the free account by providing the required
   account information.
   Once the account is registered and you are logged in, you can download the files.

   **NOTE:**
   You might have to re-access the
   [original page](https://www.renesas.com/us/en/solutions/automotive/rcar-download/rcar-demoboard-2.html)
   that contains the download links you need after creating the account and logging in.

4. **Create an Environment Variable to Point to Your Download Area:**

   Create and export an environment variable named `XDG_DOWNLOAD_DIR` that points to
   your download directory.
   Here is an example:

   ```bash
   export XDG_DOWNLOAD_DIR=$HOME/Downloads
   ```

5. **Be Sure the Files Have Rights:**

   Be sure you have the necessary rights for the files you downloaded.
   You can use the following command:

   ```bash
   chmod a+r $XDG_DOWNLOAD_DIR/*.zip
   ```

6. **Check to be Sure the Files are Downloaded and Have the Correct Rights:**

   Do a quick listing of the files to ensure they are in the download directory and
   they have the correct access rights.
   Here is an example:

   ```bash
   $ ls -l $XDG_DOWNLOAD_DIR/*.zip
   -rw-r--r-- 1 iot bzh 5431245 sept. 16 21:07 R-Car_Gen3_Series_Evaluation_Software_Package_for_Linux-weston5-20190802.zip
   -rw-r--r-- 1 iot bzh 3442158 sept. 16 21:07 R-Car_Gen3_Series_Evaluation_Software_Package_of_Linux_Drivers-weston5-20190802.zip
   ```

## 2. Getting More Software

1. **Get the `bmaptool`:**

   Download this tool from the
   [bmap-tools](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/isv:LinuxAutomotive:AGL_Master/bmap-tools)
   repository.
   The site has pre-built packages (DEB or RPM) for the supported host
   operating systems.

## 3. Getting Your Hardware Together

   Gather together this list of hardware items, which is not exhaustive.
   Having these items ahead of time saves you from having to try and
   collect hardware during development:

Supported Starter

* Kit Gen3 board with its 5V power supply.
* Micro USB-A cable for serial console.
    This cable is optional if you are using Ethernet and an SSH connection.
* USB 2.0 Hub.  The hub is optional but makes it easy to connect multiple USB devices.
* Ethernet cable.  The cable is optional if you are using a serial console.
* HDMI type D (Micro connector) cable and an associated display.
* 4 Gbyte minimum MicroSD Card.  It is recommended that you use a class 10 type.
* USB touch screen device such as the GeChic 1502i/1503i.  A touch screen device is optional.

   **NOTE:** The Salvator-X Board has NDA restrictions.
   Consequently, less documentation is available for this board both here and across the
   Internet.

## 4. Making Sure Your Build Environment is Correct

   The
   "[Initializing Your Build Environment](../image-workflow-initialize-build-environment.html#Initializing-your-build-environment)"
   section presented generic information for setting up your build environment
   using the `aglsetup.sh` script.
   If you are building an image for a supported Renesas board,
   you need to take steps to make sure your build host is set up correctly.

1. **Define Your Board:**

   Depending on your Renesas board, define and export a `MACHINE` variable as follows:

   | Board| `MACHINE` Setting |
   |:-:|:-:|
   | Starter Kit Pro/M3  | `MACHINE`=m3ulcb |
   | Starter Kit Premier/H3  | `MACHINE`=h3ulcb |
   | Salvator-X  | `MACHINE`=h3-salvator-x |

   For example, the following command defines and exports the `MACHINE` variable
   for the Starter Kit Pro/M3 Board:

   ```bash
   export MACHINE=m3ulcb
   ```

2. **Run the `aglsetup.sh` Script:**

   Use the following commands to run the AGL Setup script:

   ```bash
   cd $AGL_TOP
   source meta-agl/scripts/aglsetup.sh -m $MACHINE -b build agl-devel agl-demo agl-netboot agl-appfw-smack agl-localdev
   ```

   **NOTE:**
   Running the `aglsetup.sh` script automatically places you in the
   working directory (i.e. `$AGL_TOP/build`).
   You can change this default behavior by adding the "-f" option to the
   script's command line.

   In the previous command, the "-m" option sets your machine to the previously
   defined `MACHINE` variable.
   The "-b" option defines your Build Directory, which is the
   default `$AGL_TOP/build`.
   Finally, the AGL features are provided to support building the AGL Demo image
   for the Renesas board.

   You can learn more about the AGL Features in the
   "[Initializing Your Build Environment](../image-workflow-initialize-build-environment.html)"
   section.

3. **Examine the Script's Log:**

   Running the `aglsetup.sh` script creates the `setup.log` file, which is in
   the `build/conf` folder.
   You can examine this log to see the results of the script.
   For example, suppose the graphics drivers were missing or could not be extracted
   when you ran the script.

<details>
  <summary> In case of missing graphics drivers, you could notice an error message
   similar to the following:</summary>
  <pre>
    <code>
[snip]
--- fragment /home/working/workspace_agl_master/meta-agl/templates/machine/h3ulcb/50_setup.sh
/home/working/workspace_agl_master /home/working/workspace_agl_master/build_gen3
The graphics and multimedia acceleration packages for
the R-Car Gen3 board can be downloaded from:
https://www.renesas.com/en-us/solutions/automotive/rcar-demoboard-2.html

These 2 files from there should be store in your'/home/devel/Downloads' directory.
  R-Car_Gen3_Series_Evaluation_Software_Package_for_Linux-weston5-20190802.zip
  R-Car_Gen3_Series_Evaluation_Software_Package_of_Linux_Drivers-weston5-20190802.zip

------------ aglsetup.sh: Done
[snip]
    </code>
  </pre>
</details>

   If you encounter this issue, or any other unwanted behavior, you can fix the error
   mentioned, remove the `$AGL_TOP/build` directory, and then re-launch the
   `aglsetup.sh` again.

<details>
  <summary>Here is another example that indicates the driver files could not be extracted from the downloads directory:</summary>
  <pre>
    <code>

The graphics and multimedia acceleration packages for
the R-Car Gen3 board BSP can be downloaded from:
<https://www.renesas.com/us/en/solutions/automotive/rcar-download/rcar-demoboard-2.html>

These 2 files from there should be stored in your
'/home/iotbzh/Downloads' directory.
  R-Car_Gen3_Series_Evaluation_Software_Package_for_Linux-weston5-20190802.zip
  R-Car_Gen3_Series_Evaluation_Software_Package_of_Linux_Drivers-weston5-20190802.zip
ERROR: Script /home/iotbzh/workspace_agl/build/conf/setup.sh failed
[snip]
    </code>
  </pre>
</details>

## 5. Checking Your Configuration

Aside from environment variables and parameters you establish through
running the `aglsetup.sh` script, you can ensure your build's configuration
is just how you want it by examining the `local.conf` configuration file.

You can find this configuration file in the Build Directory (e.g.
"$TOP_DIR/build/conf/local.conf").

In general, the defaults along with the configuration fragments the
`aglsetup.sh` script applies in the `local.conf` file are good enough.
However, you can customize aspects by editing the `local.conf` file.
See the
"[Customizing Your Build](../image-workflow-cust-build.html)"
section for common configurations you might want to consider.

**NOTE:** For detailed explanations of the configurations you can make
in the ``local.conf`` file, consult the
[Yocto Project Documentation](https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/).

A quick way to see if you have the `$MACHINE` variable set correctly
is to use the following command:

```bash
grep -w -e "^MACHINE =" $AGL_TOP/build/conf/local.conf
```

Depending on the Renesas board you are using, you should see output
as follows:

```bash
  MACHINE = "h3ulcb"
```

or

```bash
  MACHINE = "m3ulcb"
```

or

```bash
  MACHINE = "h3-salvator-x"
```

If you ran the `aglsetup.sh` script as described in the
"[Making Sure Your Build Environment is Correct](./renesas.html#4-making-sure-your-build-environment-is-correct)"
section earlier, the "agl-devel", "agl-demo", "agl-netboot", "agl-appfw-smack", and
"agl-localdev" AGL features will be in effect.
These features provide the following:

* A debugger (gdb)
* Some tweaks, including a disabled root password
* A SFTP server
* The TCF Agent for easier application deployment and remote debugging
* Some extra system tools such as USB and bluetooth
* Support for the AGL demo platform
* Network boot support through TFTP and NBD protocols
* [IoT.bzh](https://iot.bzh/en/) Application Framework plus
  [SMACK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smack_(software)) and
  [Cynara](https://wiki.tizen.org/Security:Cynara)
* Support for local development including `localdev.inc` when present

## 6. Using BitBake

This section shows the `bitbake` command used to build the AGL image.
Before running BitBake to start your build, it is good to be reminded that AGL
does provide pre-built images for developers that work with supported hardware.
You can find these pre-built images on the
[AGL Download web site](https://download.automotivelinux.org/AGL/release).

For supported Renesas boards, the filenames have the following form:

```bash
<release-name>/<release-number>/m3ulcb-nogfx/deploy/images/m3ulcb/Image-m3ulcb.bin
```

Start the build using the `bitbake` command.

**NOTE:** An initial build can take many hours depending on your
CPU and and Internet connection speeds.
The build also takes approximately 100G-bytes of free disk space.

For this example, the target is "agl-demo-platform":

```bash
  bitbake agl-demo-platform
```

The build process puts the resulting image in the Build Directory:

```bash
<build_directory>/tmp/deploy/images/$MACHINE
```

## 7. Booting the Image Using a MicroSD Card

To boot your image on the Renesas board, you need to do three things:

1. Update all firmware on the board.
2. Prepare the MicroSD card to you can boot from it.
3. Boot the board.

**NOTE:** For subsequent builds, you only have to re-write the MicroSD
card with a new image.

### Updating the Board's Firmware

Follow these steps to update the firmware:

1. **Update the Sample Loader and MiniMonitor:**

   You only need to make these updates one time per device.

   Follow the procedure found on the
   eLinux.org wiki to update to at least version 3.02,
   which is mandatory to run the AGL image ([R-car loader update](https://elinux.org/R-Car/Boards/Kingfisher#How_to_update_of_Sample_Loader_and_MiniMonitor)).

2. **Update the Firmware Stack:**

   You only need to update the firmware stack if you are
   using the Eel or later (5.0) version of AGL software.

   M3 and H3 Renesas board are AArch64 platforms.
   As such, they have a firmware stack that is divided across: **ARM Trusted Firmware**, **OP-Tee** and **U-Boot**.

   If you are using the Eel (5.0) version or later of the AGL software, you must update
   the firmware using the **[h3ulcb][R-car h3ulcb firmware update](http://elinux.org/R-Car/Boards/H3SK#Flashing_firmware)**
   or **[m3ulcb][R-car m3ulcb firmware update](https://elinux.org/R-Car/Boards/M3SK#Flashing_firmware)** links from the
   [Embedded Linux Wiki](https://www.elinux.org/Main_Page) (i.e. `elinux.org`).

   The table in the wiki lists the files you need to flash the firmware.
   You can find these files in the following directory:

   ```bash
   $AGL_TOP/build/tmp/deploy/images/$MACHINE
   ```

   **NOTE:** The Salvator-X firmware update process is not documented on eLinux.

### Preparing the MicroSD Card

<details>
  <summary>
    Plug the MicroSD card into your Build Host.
    After plugging in the device, use the `dmesg` command as follows to
    discover the device name:
  </summary>
  <pre>
    <code>
$ dmesg | tail -4
[ 1971.462160] sd 6:0:0:0: [sdc] Mode Sense: 03 00 00 00
[ 1971.462277] sd 6:0:0:0: [sdc] No Caching mode page found
[ 1971.462278] sd 6:0:0:0: [sdc] Assuming drive cache: write through
[ 1971.463870]  sdc: sdc1 sdc2
    </code>
  </pre>
</details>

In the previous example, the MicroSD card is attached to the device `/dev/sdc`.

<details>
  <summary>
    You can also use the `lsblk` command to show all your devices.
    Here is an example that shows the MicroSD card as `/dev/sdc`:
  </summary>
  <pre>
    <code>
$ lsblk
  NAME   MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
  sda      8:0    0 167,7G  0 disk
  â”œâ”€sda1   8:1    0   512M  0 part /boot/efi
  â”œâ”€sda2   8:2    0 159,3G  0 part /
  â””â”€sda3   8:3    0   7,9G  0 part [SWAP]
  sdb      8:16   0 931,5G  0 disk
  â””â”€sdb1   8:17   0 931,5G  0 part /media/storage
  sdc      8:32   1  14,9G  0 disk
  â”œâ”€sdc1   8:33   1    40M  0 part
  â””â”€sdc2   8:34   1   788M  0 part
    </code>
  </pre>
</details>

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Before re-writing any device on your Build Host, you need to
be sure you are actually writing to the removable MicroSD card and not some other
device.
Each computer is different and removable devices can change from time to time.
Consequently, you should repeat the previous operation with the MicroSD card to
confirm the device name every time you write to the card.

To summarize this example so far, we have the following:

* The first SATA drive is `/dev/sda`.

* `/dev/sdc` corresponds to the MicroSD card, and is also marked as a removable device.
  You can see this in the output of the `lsblk` command where "1" appears in the "RM" column
  for that device.

Now that you have identified the device you are going to be writing the image on,
you can use the `bmaptool` to copy the image to the MicroSD card.

Your desktop system might offer a choice to mount the MicroSD automatically
in some directory.
For this example, assume that the MicroSD card mount directory is stored in the
`$SDCARD` variable.

Following are example commands that write the image to the MicroSD card:

```bash
cd $AGL_TOP/build/tmp/deploy/images/$MACHINE
bmaptool copy ./agl-demo-platform-$MACHINE.wic.xz $SDCARD
```

Alternatively, you can leave the image in an uncompressed state and write it
to the MicroSD card:

```bash
  sudo umount /dev/sdc
  xzcat ./agl-demo-platform-$MACHINE.wic.xz | sudo dd of=$SDCARD bs=4M
  sync
```

### Booting the Board

Follow these steps to boot the board:

1. Use the board's power switch to turn off the board.

2. Insert the MicroSD card into the board.

3. Verify that you have plugged in the following:

   * An external monitor into the board's HDMI port

   * An input device (e.g. keyboard, mouse, touchscreen, and so forth) into the board's USB ports.

4. Use the board's power switch to turn on the board.

After a few seconds, you will see the AGL splash screen on the display and you
will be able to log in at the console's terminal or using the graphic screen.

## 8. Setting Up the Serial Console

Setting up the Serial Console involves the following:

* Installing a serial client on your build host
* Connecting your build host to your Renesas board's serial port
* Powering on the board to get a shell at the console
* Configuring U-Boot parameters
* Logging into the console
* Determining the board's IP address

### Installing a Serial Client on Your Build Host

You need to install a serial client on your build host.
Some examples are
[GNU Screen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Screen),
[picocom](https://linux.die.net/man/8/picocom),
and
[Minicom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minicom).

Of these three, "picocom" has less dependencies and is therefore
considered the "lightest" solution.

### Connecting Your Build Host to Your Renesas Board's Serial Port

You need to physically connect your build host to the Renesas board using
a USB cable from the host to the serial CP2102 USP port (i.e. Micro USB-A port)
on the Renesas board.

<details>
  <summary>
    Once you connect the board, determine the device created for the serial link.
    Use the ``dmesg`` command on your build host.
    Here is an example:
  </summary>
  <pre>
    <code>
dmesg | tail 9
[2097783.287091] usb 2-1.5.3: new full-speed USB device number 24 using ehci-pci
[2097783.385857] usb 2-1.5.3: New USB device found, idVendor=0403, idProduct=6001
[2097783.385862] usb 2-1.5.3: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=3
[2097783.385864] usb 2-1.5.3: Product: FT232R USB UART
[2097783.385866] usb 2-1.5.3: Manufacturer: FTDI
[2097783.385867] usb 2-1.5.3: SerialNumber: AK04WWCE
[2097783.388288] ftdi_sio 2-1.5.3:1.0: FTDI USB Serial Device converter detected
[2097783.388330] usb 2-1.5.3: Detected FT232RL
[2097783.388658] usb 2-1.5.3: FTDI USB Serial Device converter now attached to ttyUSB0
    </code>
  </pre>
</details>

The device created is usually "/dev/ttyUSB0".
However, the number might vary depending on other USB serial ports connected to the host.

To use the link, you need to launch the client.
Here are three commands, which vary based on the serial client, that show
how to launch the client:

```bash
picocom -b 115200 /dev/ttyUSB0
```

or

```bash
minicom -b 115200 -D /dev/ttyUSB0
```

or

```bash
screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200
```

### Powering on the Board to Get a Shell at the Console

Both the Pro and Premier kits (e.g.
[m3ulcb](https://elinux.org/R-Car/Boards/M3SK) and
[h3ulcb](https://elinux.org/R-Car/Boards/H3SK#Hardware)) have nine
switches (SW1 through SW9).
To power on the board, "short-press" SW8, which is the power switch.

Following, is console output for the power on process for each kit:

## 9. Setting-up U-boot

### Configuring U-Boot Parameters

Follow these steps to configure the board to use the MicroSD card as the
boot device and also to set the screen resolution:

<ol>
  <li>As the board is powering up, press any key to stop the autoboot process.
   You need to press a key quickly as you have just a few seconds in which to
   press a key.
  </li>

  <li>Once the autoboot process is interrupted, use the board's serial console to
   enter <b>printenv</b> to check if you have correct parameters for booting your board:

  <li>To boot your board using the MicroSD card, be sure your environment is set up
   as follows:

  <pre>
    <code>
    setenv bootargs console=ttySC0,115200 ignore_loglevel vmalloc=384M video=HDMI-A-1:1920x1080-32@60 root=/dev/mmcblk1p1 rw rootfstype=ext4 rootwait rootdelay=2
    setenv bootcmd run load_ker\; run load_dtb\; booti 0x48080000 - 0x48000000
    setenv load_ker ext4load mmc 0:1 0x48080000 /boot/Image
    </code>
  </pre>
  </li>

  <li>Depending on the board type, the BSP version, and the existence of
   a Kingfisher board, make sure your ``load_dtb`` is set as follows:<br>

  <b>h3ulcb with BSP version greater than or equal to 2.19</b>:

  <pre>
    <code>
    setenv load_dtb ext4load mmc 0:1 0x48000000 /boot/r8a7795-es1-h3ulcb.dtb
    </code>
  </pre>

  <b>h3ulcb with BSP version less than 2.19</b>:

  <pre>
    <code>
    setenv load_dtb ext4load mmc 0:1 0x48000000 /boot/r8a7795-h3ulcb.dtb
    </code>
  </pre>

  <b>m3ulcb</b>:
  <pre>
    <code>
    setenv load_dtb ext4load mmc 0:1 0x48000000 /boot/r8a7796-m3ulcb.dtb
    </code>
  </pre>

  <b>m3ulcb with a Kingfisher board</b>:
  <pre>
    <code>
    setenv load_dtb ext4load mmc 0:1 0x48000000 /boot/r8a7796-m3ulcb-kf.dtb
    </code>
  </pre>

  <b>h3ulcb with a Kingfisher board</b>:
  <pre>
    <code>
    setenv load_dtb ext4load mmc 0:1 0x48000000 /boot/r8a7795-es1-h3ulcb-kf.dtb
    </code>
  </pre>
  </li>

  <li>Save the boot environment:<br>
    <code>
      saveenv
    </code>
  </li>

  <li>Boot the board:<br>
  <code>
    run bootcmd
  </code>
  </li>
</ol>

## 10. Troubleshooting

### Logging Into the Console

Once the board boots, you should see the
[Wayland display](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_(display_server_protocol))
on the external monitor.
A login prompt should appear as follows depending on your board:

**h3ulcb**:

```bash
Automotive Grade Linux ${AGL_VERSION} h3ulcb ttySC0

h3ulcb login: root
```

**m3ulcb**:

```bash
Automotive Grade Linux ${AGL_VERSION} m3ulcb ttySC0

m3ulcb login: root
```

At the prompt, login by using `root` as the login.
The password is "empty" so you should not be prompted for the password.

### Determining the Board's IP Address

If your board is connected to a local network using Ethernet and
if a DHCP server is able to distribute IP addresses,
you can determine the board's IP address and log in using `ssh`.

<details>
  <summary>
    Here is an example for the m3ulcb board:
  </summary>
  <pre>
    <code>
  m3ulcb login: root
  Last login: Tue Dec  6 09:55:15 UTC 2016 on tty2
  root@m3ulcb:~# ip -4 a
  1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default
      inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
        valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
  3: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP group default qlen 1000
      inet 10.0.0.27/24 brd 10.0.0.255 scope global eth0
        valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
  root@m3ulcb:~#
    </code>
  </pre>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    In the previous example, IP address is 10.0.0.27.
    Once you know the address, you can use `ssh` to login.
    Following is an example that shows logging into SSH and then
    displaying the contents of the `/etc/os-release` file:
  </summary>
  <pre>
    <code>
  $ ssh root@10.0.0.27
  Last login: Tue Dec  6 10:01:11 2016 from 10.0.0.13
  root@m3ulcb:~# cat /etc/os-release
  ID="poky-agl"
  NAME="Automotive Grade Linux"
  VERSION="3.0.0+snapshot-20161202 (chinook)"
  VERSION_ID="3.0.0-snapshot-20161202"
  PRETTY_NAME="Automotive Grade Linux 3.0.0+snapshot-20161202 (chinook)"
